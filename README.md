# PongGame

Customized Pong videogame written in Lua language with LÃ–VE2D game engine. This project is based on https://github.com/games50/pong


I programmed this for my Graphics and Videogames class, main customizations are font, an image, sound effects, background colour and most important, the velocity of the paddles and the ball increases every time any paddle intercepts the ball.
